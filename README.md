My ultimate goal for this project was to create a program that would help you budget and show where your expenses would go. I wanted to create an app that would have the user sign in, much like an atm, to see all of their stats. It would start by having you sign in, and then looking at your budget to see how you can spend your money in that allotment. It would also allow users to input purchases, as well as create categories and how much money they budget into each category.

This project was interesting to me for many reasons. Being financially responsible has always been important to me. Along with that, I am getting married in about a month, so budgeting has been on my mind a lot. I have been taught that finances are a major cause for divorce, so hopefully this will give an insight into how we should spend our money. Also, this could be a useful app to develop in the future when I am more mature in my coding skills. I think an app like this would help everyone.
